# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry
## Diverse teams are smarter and more creative

- At Intel, CEO Brian Krzanich has said: ***"A fully diverse and inclusive workplace is fundamental to our ability to innovate and deliver business results."***
## For some  leaders have noted that:
  - The tech industry is creating vast opportunity and that by excluding certain groups from that opportunity the industry is perpetuating and exacerbating existing social inequality.
