# Docs for the HTML `<canvas>` Element & Chart.js
# <canvas> 
## difference betwwen `<canvas>` and `<img>`
- `<canvas >` it doesn't have the src and alt attributes.
- `<canvas>` element has two attributes: width and height.
- These are both optional and can  be set using DOM properties.
# why chart ? 
- its better to displaying data visually.
- no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool.
- easier to look at and convey data quickly.

-write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas.
## Drawing a pie chart
`<div id="piechart"></div>`

## Drawing rectangles
- fillRect(x, y, width, height)
  - Draws a filled rectangle.
- strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
  - Draws a rectangular outline.
- clearRect(x, y, width, height)
  - Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
 ## Drawing paths
 ***beginPath() :Creates a new path. Once created, future drawing commands are directed into the path and used to build the path up.***
- Path methods :Methods to set different paths for objects.
1. closePath()
  - Adds a straight line to the path, going to the start of the current sub-path.
2. stroke()
  - Draws the shape by stroking its outline.
3. fill()
  - Draws a solid shape by filling the path's content area.
  ## Arcs
  - arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise)
  - arcTo(x1, y1, x2, y2, radius)
