# Today we get more advanced in javascript .we mainly foucased on Conditional staetments  and Loops . 
## Here are my summerized for these topics.
# *Conditional staetments  :*
-An if statement only runs a set of statements if the
condition is true: 
-An if else statement runs one set of code if the
condition is true or a different set if it is false.
# *Loops:*
-Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value .
-The loop functionality is  to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false.
-The for statement creates a loop that is executed as long as a condition is true.
-The while statement creates a loop that is executed while a specified condition is true.

# *COMPARISON OPERATORS*
## Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

## the table below shows the Operator with the Description for it:
###### ==	is equal to		
###### ===	strict equal to
###### !=	not equal	to	
###### !==	sstrict not equal to 	
###### >	greater than	
###### <	less than	
###### >=	greater than or equal to	
###### <=	less than or equal to
