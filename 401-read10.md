## What is a Stack ?
A stack is a data structure that consists of `Nodes`. Each `Node` references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

**Common terminology for a stack:**
- `Push` - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- `Pop` - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- `Top` - This is the top of the stack.
- `Peek` - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- `IsEmpty` - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

## Stacks concepts:
**FILO**
>*First In Last Out*

- This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

**LIFO**
>*Last In First Out*

## What is a Queue
**Common terminology for a queue is**
- `Enqueue` - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- `Dequeue` - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- `Front` - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- `Rear` - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- `Peek` - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- `IsEmpty` - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
