# Definition and Usage

>The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).
# HTML Element Syntax
>An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document. It represents semantics, or meaning. For example, the title element represents the title of the document.
>
>Most HTML elements are written with a start tag (or opening tag) and an end tag (or closing tag), with content in between. Elements can also contain attributes that defines its additional properties. For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the p element, would be written as:

# Definition and Usage
- The name attribute specifies a name for an HTML element.

- This name attribute can be used to reference the element in a JavaScript.

- For a <form> element, the name attribute is  used as a reference when the data is submitted.

- For an <iframe> element, the name attribute can be used to target a form submission.

- For a <map> element, the name attribute is associated with the <img>'s usemap attribute and creates a relationship between the image and the map.

- For a <meta> element, the name attribute specifies a name for the information/value of the content attribute.

- For a <param> element, the name attribute is used together with the value attribute to specify parameters for the plugin specified with the <object> tag.

# Extra Markup
- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
# Using The id Attribute
- The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

- The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.

- The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.

## The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
## <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
## The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
## Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©

# Process & Design
## In this initial stage, the designer needs to identify the end goal of the website design, usually in close collaboration with the client or other stakeholders. Questions to explore and answer in this stage of the design and website development process include:

- Who is the site for?
- What do they expect to find or do there?
- Is this website’s primary aim to inform, to sell (ecommerce, anyone?), or to amuse?
- Does the website need to clearly convey a brand’s core message, or is it part of a wider branding strategy with its own unique focus?
- What competitor sites, if any, exist, and how should this site be inspired by/different than, those competitors?

# The ABC of Programming
###### By itself, HTML doesn’t have any smarts: It can’t do math, it can’t figure out if someone has correctly filled out a form, and it can’t make decisions based on how a web visitor interacts with it. Basically, HTML lets people read text, look at pictures, watch videos, and click links to move to other web pages with more text, pictures, and videos. In order to add intelligence to your web pages so they can respond to your site’s visitors, you need JavaScript.

JavaScript lets a web page react intelligently. With it, you can create smart web forms that let visitors know when they’ve forgotten to include necessary information. You can make elements appear, disappear, or move around a web page . You can even update the contents of a web page with information retrieved from a web server—without having to load a new web page. In short, JavaScript lets you make your websites more engaging, effective, and useful.
###### Many web designers are immediately struck by the strange symbols and words used in JavaScript. An average JavaScript program is sprinkled with symbols*** ({ } [ ] ; , () !=) ***and full of unfamiliar words ***(var, null, else if)***. In many ways, learning a programming language is a lot like learning another language. You need to learn new words, new punctuation, and understand how to put them together so you can communicate successfully
