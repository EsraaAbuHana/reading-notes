# Intents, Activities, and SharedPreferences
## Understand Tasks and Back Stack
- What is a task ?
  - It is a collection of activities that users interact with when performing a certain job.
- How the back stack works ?
  - When the user presses the Back button, that new activity is finished and popped off the stack .
  - the current activity is popped from the top of the stack (the activity is destroyed) and the previous activity resumes (the previous state of its UI is restored).
  - As such, the back stack operates as a **`last in, first out`** object structure.

##### **NOTES :**
- while some task is received by user interaction in the foreground,other tasks is in the background, waiting to be resumed.

- Multiple tasks can be held in the background at once.
- Activities in the back stack are never rearranged, if your app allows users to start a particular activity from more than one activity, a new instance of that activity is created and pushed onto the stack .
 ## Managing Tasks
- How can  you start an activity whitout creating a new instance on top of the back stack?
  - with attributes in the `<activity>` manifest element and with flags in the intent that you pass to `startActivity()`.
  - principal `<activity>` attributes  can be used.
    - `taskAffinity`
    - `launchMode`
    - `allowTaskReparenting`
    - `clearTaskOnLaunch`
    - `alwaysRetainTaskState`
    - `finishOnTaskLaunch`
  - principal intent flags you can use are:
    - `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`
    - `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP`
    - `FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP`
## Defining launch modes
- `launchMode` attribute specifies an instruction on how the activity should be launched into a task.
  - launchMode attribute:
    - `standard` : The system creates a new instance of the activity in the task from which it was started and routes the intent to it .
    - `singleTop`: If an instance of the activity already exists at the top of the current task, the system routes the intent to that instance through a call to its onNewIntent() method .
    - `singleTask` : The system creates a new task and instantiates the activity at the root of the new task.
    - `singleInstance` : Same as "singleTask", except that the system doesn't launch any other activities into the task holding the instance.
  ##### **NOTE :** `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP` is most often used in conjunction with `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK.` When used together, these flags are a way of locating an existing activity in another task and putting it in a position where it can respond to the intent.
  - Handling affinities
    - You can modify the affinity for any given activity with the `taskAffinity` attribute of the `<activity>` element.
    - The `taskAffinity` attribute takes a string value, which must be unique from the default package name declared in the `<manifest>` element
  - Clearing the back stack
    - `alwaysRetainTaskState` : If this attribute is set to `true` in the root activity of a task, the default behavior just described does not happen.
    - `clearTaskOnLaunch` : If this attribute is set to "true" in the root activity of a task, the task is cleared down to the root activity whenever the user leaves the task and returns to it. 
    - `finishOnTaskLaunch` : This attribute is like clearTaskOnLaunch, but it operates on a single activity, not an entire task.
  - **Example :** OF Starting a task
```
  <activity ... >
    <intent-filter ... >
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
    ...
</activity>
```

- Get a handle to shared preferences
  - **Example Code :**
```
Context context = getActivity();
SharedPreferences sharedPref = context.getSharedPreferences(
        getString(R.string.preference_file_key), Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
```
> **to share preferences...**
```
SharedPreferences sharedPref = getActivity().getPreferences(Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
```
- Write to shared preferences
  - **Example Code :**

```
SharedPreferences sharedPref = getActivity().getPreferences(Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPref.edit();
editor.putInt(getString(R.string.saved_high_score_key), newHighScore);
editor.apply();
```
- Read from shared preferences
  - **Example Code :**

```
SharedPreferences sharedPref = getActivity().getPreferences(Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
int defaultValue = getResources().getInteger(R.integer.saved_high_score_default_key);
int highScore = sharedPref.getInt(getString(R.string.saved_high_score_key), defaultValue);
```
