# Common Terminology
- `Node` - A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes
- `Root` - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- `K` - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, `k = 2`.
- `Left` - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- `Right` - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- `Edge` - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- `Leaf` - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- `Height` - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf


# Traversals
- **Traversing a tree allows us to**
  - search for a node
  - print out the contents of a tree
  - and much more!
- **categories of traversals**
  - Depth First
  - Breadth First
#
- ***Depth First**
  * Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.

METHODS FOR DEPTH FIRST TRAVERSAL:
- `Pre-order: root >> left >> right`
- `In-order: left >> root >> right`
- `Post-order: left >> right >> root`
- ***Breadth First***
  * Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.
  * breadth first traversal uses a `queue` (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree

## Binary Trees
- ***Adding a node***
- **use of breadth first traversal** 

- Big O
  - time complexity for inserting a new node is `O(n)`
  - Searching for a specific node will also be `O(n)`
## Binary Search Trees
- A Binary Search Tree `(BST)` is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it.

In a `BST`, `nodes` are organized in a manner where all values that are
smaller than the root are placed to the left,
values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
## Searching a BST
- Why Searching a BST can be done quickly ?
  - because all you do is compare the node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree.
    - If the value is smaller, you only traverse the left side.
    - If the value is larger, you only traverse the right side.

- Big O
  - time complexity for insertion and search operations is `O(h)`
  - space complexity of a BST search would be `O(1)`.
