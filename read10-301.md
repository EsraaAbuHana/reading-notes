# What is the perpus from call stack? 
## keep track of :
- what its place in a script that calls multiple functions. 
- what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.
# How it works ?
- When a script calls a function, the interpreter:
        1. adds it to the call stack 
        2. then starts carrying out the function.
## What happen when we have one function invoke in other one ?
- the inside invoked function  are added to the call stack further up. 
- it run  where their calls are reached.
- When its finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
##  **NOTE** 
If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.
