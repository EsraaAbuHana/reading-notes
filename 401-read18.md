## [Many to many relationships](https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-many-to-many)
- **Example :** many-to-many association
- ![](https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/New.png)
  - employee can be assigned to `multiple` projects
  - project may have `multiple` employees working for it
  -  `many-to-many` association between the two.
- How to join table employee_project? 
  -connect both sides ,of( employee table with employee_id )as its `primary key` `+` a project table with project_id as its `primary key`
  ## Code it :
  - ***Database Setup***
 ######
```
CREATE TABLE `employee` (
  `employee_id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `first_name` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `last_name` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`employee_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=17 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

CREATE TABLE `project` (
  `project_id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `title` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`project_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=18 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

CREATE TABLE `employee_project` (
  `employee_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `project_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`employee_id`,`project_id`),
  KEY `project_id` (`project_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `employee_project_ibfk_1` 
   FOREIGN KEY (`employee_id`) REFERENCES `employee` (`employee_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `employee_project_ibfk_2` 
   FOREIGN KEY (`project_id`) REFERENCES `project` (`project_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```
- ***The Model Classes***
```
@Entity
@Table(name = "Employee")
public class Employee { 
    // ...
 
    @ManyToMany(cascade = { CascadeType.ALL })
    @JoinTable(
        name = "Employee_Project", 
        joinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = "employee_id") }, 
        inverseJoinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = "project_id") }
    )
    Set<Project> projects = new HashSet<>();
   
    // standard constructor/getters/setters
}
```
```
@Entity
@Table(name = "Project")
public class Project {    
    // ...  
 
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "projects")
    private Set<Employee> employees = new HashSet<>();
    
    // standard constructors/getters/setters   
}
```
#
## What to use In order to map a many-to-many association?
- `@ManyToMany`
- `@JoinTable`
- `@JoinColumn annotations`
