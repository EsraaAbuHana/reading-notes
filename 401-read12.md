## Spring RequestMapping

> ***@RequestMapping :*** is one of the most common annotation used in Spring Web applications. This annotation maps HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers. In this post, you'll see how versatile the @RequestMapping annotation is when used to map Spring MVC controller methods.
> ***What is the difference between `RequestMapping` and `GetMapping` in spring boot?***
- `RequestMapping` can be used at class level: This annotation can be used both at the class and at the method level. 
- `GetMapping` only applies to method: Annotation for mapping HTTP GET requests onto specific handler methods.
> **Examle**: @RequestMapping â€” by Path
```
@RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
@ResponseBody
public String getFoosBySimplePath() {
    return "Get some Foos";
}
```
## What is Spring Data JPA?
Spring Data JPA, part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to easily implement JPA based repositories. This module deals with enhanced support for JPA based data access layers. It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies.
## How does Spring Data JPA work?
Spring Data JPA also builds upon and enhances JPA, which stands for "Java Persistence API". Most applications are backed with some kind of data store. ... For Spring Data JPA to intelligently generate an implementation of your Repository interface, a Query DSL is needed. DSL is an acronym for Domain Specific Language.

## Difference Between CrudRepository and JPARepository in Java
|Sr. No.|Key|JPARepository|	CrudRepository|
|-------|---|-------------|---------------|
|1	|Hierarchy	|JPA extend crudRepository and PagingAndSorting repository	|Crud Repository is the base interface and it acts as a marker interface.|
|2	|Batch support	JPA also provides some extra methods related to JPA such as delete records in batch and flushing data directly to a database.|	It provides only CRUD functions like findOne, saves, etc.|
|3|	Pagination support|	JPA repository also extends the PagingAndSorting repository. It provides all the method for which are useful for implementing pagination.|	Crud Repository doesn't provide methods for implementing pagination and sorting.|
|4|	Use Case|	JpaRepository ties your repositories to the JPA persistence technology so it should be avoided.|	We should use CrudRepository or PagingAndSortingRepository depending on whether you need sorting and paging or not.|

> ***Example of JpaRepository***
```
@Repository
public interface BookDAO extends JpaRepository {
   Book findByAuthor(@Param("id") Integer id);
}
```

> ***Example of CrudRepository***
```
@Repository
public interface BookDAO extends CrudRepository {
   Book Event findById(@Param("id") Integer id);
}
```
