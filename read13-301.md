# how it works when we sending / receiving  data??!!

## On the client side: 
*defining how to send the data*
 `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent.
 The `form` attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit `button`. 

## what are the  most important attributes are used for that?
`action` and `method`.
- `action` :
   * defineing where the data gets sent.As a URL value.
   * Example: `<form action="https://example.com">`
    
* **What is the value (URL) refearse for?**
   - a file on the server that can handle the incoming data, including ensuring server-side validation. 
  
  
  `method` 
- It defines how data is sent.
- The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; 
**What are the most common methods? 
- `GET` method 
- `POST` method

## What is the  the difference between POST and GET?
, let's step back and examine how HTTP works. Each time you want to reach a resource on the Web, the browser sends a request to a URL. 
What are the HTTP request consist?
  - two parts: 
      - a header that contains a set of global metadata about the browser's capabilities.
      -  body that can contain information necessary for the server to process the specific request.
   
   #  `GET` method: 
## *Uses*
1. it used by the browser to ask the server.
2.  send back a given resource.
3. The data is appended to the URL as a series of name/value pairs.

# `POST` method:
- ***It as simple as that :***
 - "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.
