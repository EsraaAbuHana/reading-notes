# JavaScript Objects
- Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
- The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
- JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.
- Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines.
# Accessing Object Properties
## You can access object properties in two ways:

_ ***objectName.propertyName***

_ ***objectName["propertyName"]***

# Document Object Model


## With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

- JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
- JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
- JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
- JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
- JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
# DOM TREE 
## What is the DOM?
*The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.*
# ![](https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif)
# ACCESSING ELEMENTS
###### DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist,
which is a collection of nodes.
#
## .getElementsByClassName( )
###### This method uses the class attribute of an element in order to gain access to it. This allows you to be more specific than .getElementsByTagName() because it will only return the elements that contain the class name you specify within the parentheses.
#
# NODELISTS: 
- DOM QUERIES THAT RETURN MORE THAN ONE ELEMENT
- When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element).
## SELECTING ELEMENTS
USING CLASS ATTRIBUTES The get El ementsByCl ass Name()
method allows you to select elements whose c 1 ass attribute contains a specific va lue.
