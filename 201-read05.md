# IMAGESE

## How to add images to pages
> in html when you write for example this inside the body:
> ## img src="https://cdo-curriculum.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/img_tag.png" alt="img tag" width="500" height="300" ***inside <>***
> thats what will appere:
> ![img tag](https://cdo-curriculum.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/img_tag.png)
> *Include an image in your web pages using HTML*
> The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
>
> Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
>
> The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
>
> The <img> tag has two required attributes:
>
> _src - Specifies the path to the image
> _alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
>
> *Pick which image format to use*
>
> hint to applay: all of the images are stored in a folder called ***images***.images such
> as logos and buttons might sit in a folder called ***interface***, product
> photographs might sit in a page called ***products***, and images
> related to news might live in a folder called ***news***.
> Where to Place Images in Your Code
> 1. before a paragraph
> The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.
> 2. inside the start of a paragraph
> The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.
> 3. in the middle of a paragraph
> The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.
>
> *Show an image at the right size*
>
> *Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages load faster*
## Choosing the right format
> Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
> logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
