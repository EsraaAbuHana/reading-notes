## Variables on JAava : 


- ***Instance Variables :*** 
> (Non-Static Fields) are also known as instance variables because their values are unique to each instance of a class (to each object, in other words);
- ***Class Variables***
> (Static Fields) A class variable is any field declared with the static modifier; this tells the compiler that there is exactly one copy of this variable in existence, regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated.
- ***Local Variables***
>  only visible to the methods in which they are declared; they are not accessible from the rest of the class.
- ***Parameters*** 
>  Parameters are always classified as "variables" not "fields". This applies to other parameter-accepting constructs as well 
## Naming Useful Rules :
  - Variable names are case-sensitive.
  - begin your variable names with a letter.
  - use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations.
  - Dont choose a keyword or reserved word.
  - If the name consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.
  
 ## Default Values:

|Data Type|	Default Value (for fields)|Example|
|---------|---------------------------|-------|
|byte|0|byte b = 100;|
|short|0|short s = 10000;|
|int|0|int i = 100000;|
|long	|0L|long myNum = 15000000000L;|
|float|0.0f|float f = 4.5f;|
|double	|0.0d|double d = 4.5;|
|char	|'\u0000'|char capitalC = 'C';|
|String (or any object)  	|null|String greeting = "Hello World";|
|boolean	|false|boolean result = true;|

#
> ***Array Example:***
- `int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`
> *** To print array :***

- `for (int i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {`
-  ` System.out.println(arr[i]);`
- `}`

## Operators
***he Arithmetic Operators***

|Operator|	Description|
|--------|-------------|
|`+`|Additive operator (also used for String concatenation)|
|`-`|	Subtraction operator|
|`*`|Multiplication operator|
|`/`|	Division operator|
|`%`|	Remainder operator|


***The Unary Operators***
|Operator|	Description|
|--------|-------------|
|`+`|Unary plus operator; indicates positive value (numbers are positive without this, however)|
|`-`|	Unary minus operator; negates an expression|
|`++`|Increment operator; increments a value by 1|
|`--`|	Decrement operator; decrements a value by 1|
|`!`|	Logical complement operator; inverts the value of a boolean|

***The Equality and Relational Operators***
|Operator|	Description|
|--------|-------------|
|`== `|equal to|
|`!= `|	not equal to|
|`> `|greater than|
|`>= `|	 greater than or equal to|
|`< `|	less than|
|`<= `| less than or equal to|

## Expressions, Statements, and Blocks
- ***expression*** : is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.

- ***Statements :*** are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution.
- ***block :*** is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.

## Control Flow Statements
- decision-making statements 
  - (`if-then`, `if-then-else`, `switch`)
- the looping statements 
  - (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- branching statements
  - (`break`, `continue`, `return`)

# What does it mean to compile code?
Compiling is the transformation from Source Code (human readable) into machine code (computer executable). ... A compiler takes the recipe (code) for a new program (written in a high level language) and transforms this Code into a new language (Machine Language) that can be understood by the computer itself.
