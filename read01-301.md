- The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

## float property values:

- `left` - The element floats to the left of its container
- `right` - The element floats to the right of its container
- `none` - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
- `inherit` - The element inherits the float value of its parent

## The clear Property
- The `clear` property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.
