# Related Resources and Integration Testing
## how to work with relationships between entities in Spring Data REST
## **One-to-One Relationship**
- Let's suppose we are building a user management system, and our boss asks us to store a mailing address for each user. A user will have one mailing address, and a mailing address will have only one user tied to it.
- This is an example of a one-to-one relationship, in this case between user and address entities.
- **Example :**
```
@OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "address_id")
    @RestResource(path = "libraryAddress", rel="address")
    private Address address;

```
- Creating the Associations
   - This is done using the HTTP method PUT, which supports a media type of text/uri-list, and a body containing the URI of the resource to bind to the association.
   - **Example :**
   ```
   curl -i -X PUT -d "http://localhost:8080/addresses/1" 
    -H "Content-Type:text/uri-list" http://localhost:8080/libraries/1/libraryAddress
   ```
## **One-to-Many Relationship**
- **Example :**
>
>

```
public class Library {

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "library")
    private List<Book> books;

}
```
## **Many-to-Many Relationship**
- A many-to-many relationship is defined using @ManyToMany annotation, to which we can add @RestResource.
```
public class Book {
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "books")
    private List<Author> authors;

}
```
# 
# Integration Testing in Spring
- The integration testing role in the application development cycle is verifying the end-to-end behavior of a system.
## Spring MVC Test Configuration
- **Enable Spring in Tests with JUnit 5**
>
>
```
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = { ApplicationConfig.class })
@WebAppConfiguration
public class GreetControllerIntegrationTest {
    ....
}
```

- **Verify Test Configuration**
>
>
```
@Test
public void givenWac_whenServletContext_thenItProvidesGreetController() {
    ServletContext servletContext = webApplicationContext.getServletContext();
    
    Assert.assertNotNull(servletContext);
    Assert.assertTrue(servletContext instanceof MockServletContext);
    Assert.assertNotNull(webApplicationContext.getBean("greetController"));
}
```
- **Writing Integration Tests**
>
>
```
@Test
public void givenHomePageURI_whenMockMVC_thenReturnsIndexJSPViewName() {
    this.mockMvc.perform(get("/homePage")).andDo(print())
      .andExpect(view().name("index"));
}
```
#
## MockMvc Limitations

- it does use a subclass of the DispatcherServlet to handle test requests. 

- The MockMvc class wraps this TestDispatcherServlet internally. So, every time we send a request using the perform() method, MockMvc will use the underlying TestDispatcherServlet directly. 

- because Spring prepares a fake web application context to mock the HTTP requests and responses, it may not support all features of a full-blown Spring application.
