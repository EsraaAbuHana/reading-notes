## Save data in a local database using Room 
- WHAT is Room?
  - Room is an `ORM` (object relational mapper) for `SQLite` database in Android. It is part of the Architecture Components released by Google.
- WHY we use Room ?
  - Room allows you to:
    - create and manipulate database in Android more quickly.
    -  See it as an abstraction layer on top of inbuilt SQLite database.
- JUSTIFY: " its highly recommend that you use `Room` instead of using the `SQLite APIs` directly." 
  - because Room provides the following benefits:
    - Compile-time verification of SQL queries.
    - Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
    - Streamlined database migration paths.
 ### Primary components 
 |Component|Object of it|
 |---------|------------|
 |[database class](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/room/Database)|holds the database and serves as the main access point for the underlying connection to your app's persisted data.|
 |[Data entities](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data)| represent tables in your app's database.|
 |[Data access objects (DAOs)](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/accessing-data)|provide methods that your app can use to query, update, insert, and delete data in the database.|
   ### HOW To use Room in your app ?
   1. Setup :
      - add the dependencies to your app's `build.gradle file` as written in this sample code>> [check the code](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room#setup)
   2. Implement a Room database :
      - Follow [this example implementation](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room#sample-implementation) of a Room database with a single data entity and a single DAO.
        - Define Data entity :  Each instance of class represents a row in the creatted table in the app's database.
        - Define Data access object (DAO) : which provides the methods that the rest of the app uses to interact with data in the creatted table.
        - Define Database : defines an AppDatabase class to hold the database.
        - Usage : write a code to create an instance of the database.

  ## Defining data using Room entities
- ***EXPLAIN :*** that we CAN use Room entities to define a database schema without writing any SQL code ?
  - >> by useing the Room persistence library to store your app's data
  - >> you define entities to represent the objects that you want to store. 
  - >> and each entity corresponds to a table in the associated Room database, and each instance of an entity represents a row of data in the corresponding table.
  ## Anatomy of an entity
  #### Here is some example code of it :
  - Example of a simple entity :
 ```
 @Entity
public class User {
    @PrimaryKey
    public int id;

    public String firstName;
    public String lastName;
}
 ```
 - Example demonstrates custom names for tables and columns :
 ```
 @Entity(tableName = "users")
public class User {
    @PrimaryKey
    public int id;

    @ColumnInfo(name = "first_name")
    public String firstName;

    @ColumnInfo(name = "last_name")
    public String lastName;
}
 ```
 #### Define a primary key
  - The most straightforward way of doing this is to annotate a single column with `@PrimaryKey`:
```
 @PrimaryKey
 public int id;
```
#### Define a composite primary key :
 - you can define a composite primary key by listing those columns in the `primaryKeys` property of `@Entity` AS:
 `@Entity(primaryKeys = {"firstName", "lastName"})`
 #### Ignore fields
 - If an entity has fields that you don't want to persist, you can annotate them using `@Ignore`
 #### Provide table search support : check this [code](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data#search)
 #### Index specific columns : check this [code](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data#column-indexing)
 ### Include AutoValue-based objects: check this [code](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data#autovalue)
 #
 ## Accessing data using Room DAOs
 ### Insert 
 - allows you to define methods that insert their parameters into the appropriate table in the database
 ```
  @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE)
    public void insertUsers(User... users);

    @Insert
    public void insertBothUsers(User user1, User user2);
 ```
 ### Update
 - allows you to define methods that update specific rows in a database table
 ```
    @Update
    public void updateUsers(User... users);
 ```
 ### Delete
 - allows you to define methods that delete specific rows from a database table.
```
 @Delete
    public void deleteUsers(User... users);
```
