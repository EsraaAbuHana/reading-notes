# 1.functional programming
## What is it?
- a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs .
## **methodology:**
 treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data .
 ***1.Pure functions***
- how do we know if a function is pure or not?
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- # Why Pure functions is great ?!
- The code’s definitely easier to test.
- We don’t need to mock anything. 
## How we test pure functions ?
> **2 different contexts:**
- Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
- Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D

# 2.Immutability
***how we could immutabil ourcode ?***
- `toLowerCase:` converts the string to all lower case
- `trim:` removes whitespace from both ends of a string
- `split` and `join:` replaces all instances of match with replacement in a given string
- We combine all these 4 functions and we can "`slugify`" our string.
# 3.Functions as first-class entities
***Functions as first-class entities can:***
- refer to it from constants and variables
- pass it as a parameter to other functions
- return it as result from other functions
- The idea is to treat functions as values and pass functions like data.
