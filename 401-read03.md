## Java Primitives versus Objects
![](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/Pros-Cons-of-Java-tv-1.jpg)
* Every primitive type corresponds to a reference type.
* Every object contains a single value of the corresponding primitive type. The are immutable (so that their state can't change once the object is constructed) and are final 
*Explain:* we can't inherit from  wrapper classes.
-  The are immutable , their state can't change once the object is constructed, and are final.
   - `Integer j = 1;          // autoboxing`
   - `int i = new Integer(1); // unboxing`
**What is autoboxing**
- The process of converting a primitive type to a reference one.The opposite process is called unboxing.
## Primitive Types and Values

## Performance

Factors that  performance of a Java code depends on :
- the hardware on which the code runs.
- the compiler that might perform certain optimizations.
- the state of the virtual machine.
- the activity of other processes in the operating system.



To demonstrate how much the operations for primitive types are faster than those for wrapper classes, let's create a five million element array in which all elements are equal except for the last one; then we perform a lookup for that element:

while (!pivot.equals(elements[index])) {
    index++;
}
and compare the performance of this operation for the case when the array contains variables of the primitive types and for the case when it contains objects of the reference types.

We use the well-known JMH benchmarking tool (see our tutorial on how to use it), and the results of the lookup operation can be summarized in this chart:
# Exceptions
***Definition:*** An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

## Scanning
Objects of type Scanner are useful for breaking down formatted input into tokens and translating individual tokens according to their data type.
