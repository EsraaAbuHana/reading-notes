# Process & Design
*How to approach building a site
*Understanding your audience and their needs
*How to present information visitors want to see
>
**Every website should be designed for the
target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.

>Companies

*Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.
>
*You know who is coming to your site and why
they are coming, so now you need to work out
what information they need in order to achieve
their goals quickly and effectively.
>
*Some sites benefit from being updated more
frequently than others. Some information (such
as news) may be constantly changing, while
other content remains relatively static.
*Goods / Services
*Information

Now that you know what needs to appear
on your site, you can start to organize the
information into sections or pages.

#A wireframe
*is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.
# *Context
Good navigation provides
context. It lets the user know
where they are in the website at
that moment. Using a different
color or some kind of visual
marker to indicate the current
page is a good way to do this.
# *Interactive
Each link should be big enough
to click on and the appearance
of the link should change when
the user hovers over each item
or clicks on it. It should also
be visually distinct from other
content on the page.
# *Consistent
The more pages a site contains,
the larger the number of
navigation items there will be.
Although secondary navigation
will change from page to page,
it is best to keep the primary
navigation exactly the same


# Summary
PROCESS & Design
It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

# Summary
## HTML5 LAYOUT


The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
