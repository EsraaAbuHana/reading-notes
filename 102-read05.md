## I'm trying to tell my non-technical friend who interested  in learning web design !!!
## My plan is: trying to  convice him to enter the field, so I will tell him about CSS specifically about these main points:
###### 1.*What CSS does*
###### 2.*CSS works*
###### 3.*Rules, properties, and values*
## CSS is responsible for displaying web pages along with the HTML & JS software, when you browse your browser and see its contents, starting from :
###### *format* 
###### *design* 
###### *images*
###### *colors and many things*
## *What CSS does*
Mainly , CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.
## *CSS works*
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
## *Rules, properties, and values*


## rules 
are simple ,CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon. 
  
## Properties  
indicate the aspects
of the element you want to
change. For example, color, font,
width, height and border.

## Values 
specify the settings
you want to use for the chosen
properties. For example, if you
want to specify a color property
then the value is the color you
want the text in these elements
to be.
