## we learned a lot of things today, mainly with commands.
## *unfortunately I couldn’t find chance to apply what we have learned, because I still facing a technical issue. but I’m really excited and I’m look forward what’s next. *
## *so hear it is my summary: *
## *Linux has a graphical user interface and it works pretty much like the GUI's on other systems. 
## *A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. 

# And here are some commands and its job:
## The command pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. It tells you what your current or present working directory is. 

> - ls = list
> - cd = change directory
> - pwd = print working direct
> - Tree = whole directory of the device visualized
> - cd.. = previous directory
> - ls-l = detailed directory
> - mkdir = create folder
> - touch = creates file
> - code . = opens VS
> - clear = deletes log
