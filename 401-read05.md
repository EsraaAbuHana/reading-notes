# Linked Lists
## What is a Linked List?
It is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.Each Node references the next Node in the link.
## Types of Linked List:
- Singly.
- Doubly.

|Terminology|Diffinition|
|-----------|-----------|
|Linked List|A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list|
|`Singly`  |refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list|
|`Doubly `|refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node|
|`Node`|are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link|
|`Next `|Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node|
|`Head `|is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.|
|`Current`|is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.|

# Traversal
##  The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of? justifu:
- `while `not `foreach`or`for`loop.
- This allows us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null.
## What is the importancy of `Next` property?
- it will lead us where the next node is and allow us to extract the data appropriately.

## ***data structures***:
>
>   are the different ways that we can organize our data; variables, arrays, hashes, and objects are all types of data structures.

***Linear data structures***

- What we mean by linked lists is that they are linear data structures?
- means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. 
- note that in non-linear structures,items don’t have to be arranged in order.

## ***`A node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is.`***

# Big O
## what even is Big O notation?
- is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.
## There are two major points to consider when thinking about how an algorithm performs: how much time it requires at runtime given how much time and memory it needs.
