# What we do to make the computer do ?
## Processing: It takes information from memory and processes it using algorithms, then returns it to memory, 'ested  in learning web design !!!
## What is a computer and how does it work?
 Let's start simply and in sequence.
One of the first things you interact with is text, sound, maybe movement, etc.
All of this is information that the computer receives and it is an input, what next?
These entries are stored and saved in the computer's memory, what next ?!
After the computer stores the inputs, the processing process begins: identifying the data, processing it and performing operations on it, and this process continues until the correct output is reached.
## Well, how does this computer perform these operations ?!
The computer consists of many electrical circuits, and these circuits are wires that implement only two states that open or close the circuit
Yes No
true False
on \ off
.

This is what the computer understands with 1/0 binary system, work system, virtual reality, games, car systems.
Each wire in the electrical circuit has the two values ​​0/1, when there are more than one wire, and each specific number gives us specific information, whether it is a number or a letter. And you can imagine what comes next!
