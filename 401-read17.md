# Spring Boot and OAuth2
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/902/1*Vm4d5U8ZCx8VnxdPyELY1Q.png)
> ***There are several samples building on each other, adding new features at each step:***

- `simple`: a very basic static app with just a home page and unconditional login via Spring Boot’s OAuth 2.0 configuration properties (if you visit the home page, you will be automatically redirected to GitHub).

- `click`: adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login.

- `logout`: adds a logout link as well for authenticated users.

- `two-providers`: adds a second login provider so the user can choose on the home page which one to use.

- `custom-error`: adds an error message for unauthenticated users, and a custom authentication based on GitHub’s API.
## how to run the app ?
- You can run the main method in `SocialApplication` to start an app
- You can also run all the apps on the command line using mvn spring-boot:run 
## Securing the Application with GitHub and Spring Security
- include the Spring Security OAuth 2.0 Client starter:
```
pom.xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
## How I Can Make the Home Page Public ?
- To make the link visible, we  need to switch off the security on the home page by extending `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`
