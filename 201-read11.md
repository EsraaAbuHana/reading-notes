## Controlling size of images in CSS
*Using The width Property*
- If the width property is set to a percentage and the height is set to "auto", the image will be responsive and scale up and down.

*Using The max-width Property*
- If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size.
this is a funny explenation I founded it on [Max-Width](https://blog.prototypr.io/what-even-is-the-difference-between-width-and-max-width-8f37b282c7f1)
* "Max-width tells the browser this:
* Dear browser,
* No matter the circumstances involved, kindly do not exceed this width that I wrote here. I mean, you can probably be less than my allocated width, when you need to, but never be more than this width that I’ve put right here. Don’t even consider it.
* Yours truly,
* max-width."

# How To Center Images???
To center an image, set left and right margin to auto and make it into a block element:
## *example code :*

`center {display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;}`
# background-image:
- sets one or more background images for an element.

- placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.

- The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).
- use as :
> `{background-image: url(url of image);}`
## background-attachment:
-  sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.
## background-repeat:
-sets if/how a background image will be repeated.
