 # __*growth mindset*__
##  Talking about a growth mindset is so much fun, and I can never be bored of it.
## It is simply a like a growth of baby;  
## needs for Food protection, play and involvement in many everyday situations, faced problems and a little of pain.
 This is exactly what our minds need, a lot of ideas that develop our mind.
 It needs a lot of challenges and obstacles that force it to develop and to expressing new horizons, and think out of the box. We will not be able to develop our minds by "  *USED TO* “and be relaxing with routine in live, job, ideas, etc., 
 I find my *pleasure of achieve* in the face of difficult challenges, situations that require thinking in a new way. also criticism is a very affective factor in our talking  which is back with the positive feedback on us. In my opinion, this is what distinguishes us and gives us experiences, strength and leadership. 
 all the things that I have just mention them above could not be happened by my own or even you, each one of us has his or her unique by the strengthens and weakness points,  only doing relations and communicating, and of course *the power of the word "TEAM”* what show the best of us.
