# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model
## hers is my summurived for this Read.
>
# first:Lists
*There are three t XX ypes of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.*
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.
>
# we talked before about 
***Ordered lists*** useing <ol> <li>:
> are lists where each item in the list is
numbered.
>
***Unordered lists*** using <ul> <li>:
> are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
>
## ***The definition list:***
> are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
>

# <dl> 
> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and their definitions.Inside the <dl> element you will usually see pairs of <dt> and<dd> elements.
# <dt>
> This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
# <dd>
> This is used to contain the definition. Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different definitions for the same term.
>
## ***Nested Lists***
> You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list. Browsers display nested lists indented further than the parent list. In nested unordered lists, the browser will usually change the style of the bullet point too.

# Second: Boxes
## Controlling size of boxes
- Box model for borders, margin and padding
- Displaying and hiding boxes
>
## box available properties appearance:
>
***Border***
> Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
>
***Margin***
> Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
>
***Padding***
> Padding is the space between the border of a box and anycontent contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.
>
# third:Overflowing Content
## overflow
> The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have
>
## *one of two values:*
- ***hidden***
> This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
>
- ***scroll***
> This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.
>
>
## here is some new tips:
> Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

# Fourth:ARRAYS
> An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other.
>
## CREATING AN ARRAY
>
## VALUES IN ARRAYS
> Values in an array are accessed as if they are ina numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).
>

# Fifth:SWITCH STATEMENTS
> we learned before about if else statements, for now we talked about :
>

## ***A switch statement***
> starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
>

# sixth:LOOPS
> There are three types of loop: for, while, and do while. Each repeats a set of statements
## ***USING DO WHILE LOOPS****
>The key difference between a whi 1 e loop and a do whi1e loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met.
