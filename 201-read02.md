## Headings and paragraphs
HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.

 # HTML Formatting Elements
## Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

- <b> - Bold text
- <strong> - Important text
- <i> - Italic text
- <em> - Emphasized text
- <mark> - Marked text
- <small> - Smaller text
- <del> - Deleted text
- <ins> - Inserted text
- <sub> - Subscript text
- <sup> - Superscript text
## HTML <b> and <strong> Elements
## ***<strong>***
###### The use of the <strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words
contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis. By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong> element in bold.
## <em>
The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. By default browsers will show the contents of an <em> element in italic.
## <b>
###### The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.
