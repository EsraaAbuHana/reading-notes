> Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
> of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can
> control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the
> boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use
> borders, margins, padding, and background colors.
