# Java Scrript
> You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. For example:
* Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page
* Select any elements that have a
c1ass attribute with a value of note
* Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of email
# MODIFY CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them. For example:
* Add a paragraph of text after the
first <hl> element
* Change the value of c1ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements
* Change the size or position of an
<img> element
# PROGRAM RULES
You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page. For example:
* A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.
* A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a fo rm, perform a
calculation, and display repayments.
* An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window
and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area (also known as
the viewport).

# REACT TO EVENTS
You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred. For
example, it could be run when:
* A button is pressed
* A link is clicked (or tapped) on
* A cursor hovers over an element
* Information is added to a form
* An interval of time has passed
* A web page has finished loading
Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps.
# 1: DEFINE THE GOAL
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve.
# 2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT
To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.
You can then write down individual steps that the
computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it
can follow.
# 3: CODE EACH STEP
Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.
As tempting as it can be to start coding straight
away, it pays to spend time designing your script
before you start writing it.
A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).



###### _ADDITION +  Adds one value to another
###### _SUBTRACTION _ Subtracts one value from another
###### _DIVISION / Divides two values
###### _MULTIPLICATION * Multiplies two values using an asterisk
###### _DECREMENT --
###### _MODULUS %

> Several arithmetic operations
> can be performed in one
expression, but it is important
to understand how the result
will be calculated. Multiplication
and division are performed
before addition or subtraction.
This can affect the number that
you expect to see. To illustrate
this effect, look at the following
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
There are many occasions where
you may need to join two or
more strings to create a single
value. Programmers call the
process of joining together two
or more strings to create one
new string concatenation.
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
