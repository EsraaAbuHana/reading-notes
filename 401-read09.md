## HTTP request lifecycle
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/689/1*4SEvcz6KvyaqOqBpJABTBg.png)
> **Step 1: Local Processing**
Your browser extracts the "scheme"/protocol (we have established
that this will be HTTP), host `(www.example.com)`,
and optional port number, resource path, and query strings that are specified in the form
`<protocol>://<host><:optional port>/<path/to/resource><?query>.`
>***example***:
>  `|http|://|www.example.com||:5000||/mainpage||?query=param&query2=param2|`


> **Step 2: Resolve an IP**
- resolving an IP from a "DNS server"2 is a sequence that includes many steps, and includes failovers if the first request fails to return an address.
- The DNS request contains the preconfigured IP for your DNS server and your return IP in its header. 
> **Step 3: Establish a TCP Connection**
- client has an IP address, it can send an HTTP5 request, right? Almost, but first, since the request is sent over TCP6, which is a transport layer protocol like UDP, the client must open a TCP connection. 

- One of the key differences between TCP and UDP is that TCP ensures delivery and ordered data transmission. Much of this is done very simply, using what’s known as a sequence number for every byte sent. This allows the receiver to re-order received packets back into their original order, and allows the sender to retransmit any packet that does not get acknowledged by the receiver.

**Step 4: Send an HTTP Request**
- the client has an IP address and a TCP connection, it can finally send an HTTP request! Except…..no I’m kidding, we can send a request for real this time!

- The request is made up of a `"request line"`, `request header`, and a `body`. 
> **Step 5: Tearing Down and Cleaning Up**

-  the client sends a FIN packet at the TCP level, to which the server responds with an ACK, and then generally sends a FIN of its own, which the client responds to with its own ACK signal.

# Java HTTP Request example
**NOTE**:
The HttpUrlConnection class allows us to perform basic HTTP requests without the use of any additional libraries. 
- Creating a Request
```
URL url = new URL("http://example.com");
HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
con.setRequestMethod("GET");
```

- Adding Request Parameters
```
Map<String, String> parameters = new HashMap<>();
parameters.put("param1", "val");

con.setDoOutput(true);
DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(con.getOutputStream());
out.writeBytes(ParameterStringBuilder.getParamsString(parameters));
out.flush();
out.close();
```

- Reading the Response
```
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
  new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream()));
String inputLine;
StringBuffer content = new StringBuffer();
while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
    content.append(inputLine);
}
in.close();
```
