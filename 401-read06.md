# Inheritance and Interfaces
## What Is Inheritance?

## Description:
- ***Inheritance*** is one of the most-used features of Object-Oriented Programming. It denotes a methodology through which a newly built class extracts features (methods and variables/fields) from an already existing class. With the implementation of inheritance, information gets available in a hierarchical order.

According to the hierarchical style, the class which inherits the features of the already existing class is known as a ***subclass or a derives/child class****.

***Syntax:****
>
> `class Parent {`
>
>  ` // methods`
> ` // fields`
>
>  `// ……`
>`}`
>
> `class Child extends Parent {`
>
>   `// already supports the methods and fields in Parent class`
>  `// additional features`
> `}`

## What Is an Interface?

## Description:
- An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
- The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body.
-  It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
- In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body.

**Note:**To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented" (kinda like inherited) by another class with the `implements` keyword (instead of `extends`).
> ***Syntax:****

> `interface Bank{ `
> 
>   `float rateOfInterest(); `
>  ` }`
>  
> `class SBI implements Bank{`  
> `public float rateOfInterest(){return 9.15f;}`  
> `}`
